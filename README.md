# Real Estate House Price Prediction Project

This repository contains the code for a machine learning project that predicts the price of a house based on its features. The project uses the following techniques:

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data and identify the most important features.
Linear regression to build a simple model that predicts the price of a house based on its features.
Random forest to build a more complex model that can handle non-linear relationships between the features and the price.
Streamlit GUI to create a web application that allows users to predict the price of a house by entering its feature
